Note most other courses use stock data and create trading algorithms.  Here we are going to focus on core financial analyst tasks, e.g. what is the average PPP loan size in Texas? These questions are increasingly being answered in Python rather than Excel.

We can provide exercises at the end of each session.  The students can complete these in a Jupyter notebook, and we can provide solutions.  Do we want to attempt to grade them?

* Week 1 (Setup)

** Session 1

- Course Overview:  
  + What we will cover in the course.  
  + The use of Python in finance.

- Python Relative to other tools.
  + Excel
  + Other Programming Languages
  + Comparison with R
  + Using Javascript for Visualization

** Session 2

-  Interacting with Python
  + Google's Colab and Jupyter
    - Introduction to markdown
    - Installing and loading packages.
    - Sharing notebooks
  + You are on a Linux Server
  + **Creating Functions and Time-Value-of-Money calculations**.
-  Python Classes and Object Orientation
  + What is a Class

  data
  + Example: Coinbase API
  + Example: Interactive Brokers API
  + EIA API.
- Connecting to databases.

*** Exercise: Pull stock data via API and estimate a Markowitz mean-variance optimal portfolio.
